\usage{
connectivity_matrix(clusters)
}
\arguments{
\item{clusters}{a vector of clusterings. Zero elements mean that the sample was absent
during clustering}
}
\description{
Build connectivity matrix
}
\details{
Connectivity matrix (M) is a binary matrix N-by-N
 M[i,j] = 1 if sample i and j are in the same cluster
